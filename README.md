## Reflection
#### Summary
This project was an great experience for deepening my knowledge of React.js in combination with Redux to handle state management. Also, I added a backend to make it a full stack application in the addition of storing and retrieving highscores from a mongodb database and using node and express to serve the files.

#### Future Plans
* Improvement on mine placement algorithm to rid of possibility to click a mine on the first click
